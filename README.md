# Near Earth Objects Database

This repository contains a Java application that interacts with NASA's Near Earth Object Web Service (NeoWS) API to manage data on asteroids. Users can view, sort, and display NEO data fetched live from NASA's API. The project uses the BigData library to parse JSON data into Java objects for easier handling.

## Features

- Add Data Pages: Retrieve and add pages of NEO data from NASA's NeoWS API.
- Sort Data: Sort the NEO data based on various criteria such as reference ID, average diameter, closest approach date, and miss distance.
- Display Data: Print the database in a formatted table.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/near-earth-objects-database.git
   cd near-earth-objects-database
